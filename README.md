# Brainfuck Interpreter Visualizer

## Brainfuck

`Brainfuck` is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It consists of only 8 characters that represent the possible commands in a program. While it's fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

## Three.js

The visualization module of this project is powered by [three.js](https://threejs.org/), a lightweight library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

## Project

This is a school `open source` project developed for the Software Architecture and Design course during Aug-Dec 2017.
